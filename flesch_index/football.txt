Football is something I am fond of, both to play and to watch others play. It is something that I grew to like when I was 10 years old.
Actually, it was exactly during the 2014 FIFA World Cup over 10 years ago that I started to really like football. I was gifted a Germany
2014 original football jersey by my cousin brother. I also got a replica of the World Cup matchball, the Brazuca, as a complimentary
gift when we bought a washing machine. I watched the world cup,atleast some of the matches, with my cousins and grandfather. I also 
started to become a Lionel Messi fan due to his performance in the tournament. Argentina losing the final to Germany was a disappointing
end to the tournament. I also got gifted a Lionel Messi Barcelona jersey set by the same cousin brother later on in the year. I also started
to play football a lot more seriously, both at school and mainly with two of my closest cousins. Nowadays, although I watch football, I don't
play much. It has maybe been a year since I last kicked a ball. I do think playing it again would give me a lot of joy as it used to back then.
